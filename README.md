# FlappyBird_Python

I have made this game with just common functions with the help of PYGAME community

pip install pygame   (Python version-3.5+ is required)

pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications 
like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries
to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.

This primer assumes you have a basic understanding of writing Python programs, including user-defined functions,
imports, loops, and conditionals. You should also be familiar with how to open files on your platform. 
A basic understanding of object-oriented Python is helpful as well.
